# Mapty

A vanilla JavaScript based web application to record workouts on an interactive map.

To run: recommend to clone locally and use [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)

I plan to deploy the app on Heroku and possibly use MongoDB for data storage in final version.

Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
